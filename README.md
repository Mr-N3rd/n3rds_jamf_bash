# Mr Nerds Jamf Bash (scripts) 
These are some scripts I wrote to give Jamf the specific functionality that I was looking for that was essentially missing.

## The Policy Playlist

This Script can be added in to jamf for running computer scripts in a specific order. 
I just didn't like how Jamf ran their policy ordering, so I made a simple bash script to validate and run all the scripts required in order.
